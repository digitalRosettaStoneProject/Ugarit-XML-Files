# Ugarit-XML-Files
XML files of the alignment of the Rosetta Stone in the Ugarit iAligner

Here, you can find the XML files downloaded from the alignment tool [Ugarit iAligner](https://ugarit.ialigner.com/userProfile.php?userid=74&tgid=411) from our account "Digital Rosetta Stone / The Rosetta Stone (synoptic version II)". It features an alignment of all three inscriptions with English translations by Quirke/Andrews 1988: 16-22. The alignment was created by Josephine Hensel. In 2024, Ugarit supported more fitting versions of the transliteration signs of aleph and ajin. Therefore, the XML files have been updated by Franziska Naether and Ugarit founder Tariq Yousef.

NB: In Ugarit, you can find further alignments of the three version - check them out in our [user profile](https://ugarit.ialigner.com/userProfile.php?userid=74)!
